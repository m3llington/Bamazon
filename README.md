# Bamazon
Amazon like storefront
For this activity we were tasked with using both node.js, and mySQL to create an amazon like storefront. Includes he seeds file so the information on the database can be easily replicated by a user. 

Instructions: The user simply needs to run the bamazonCustomer.js with node, and then after that select the ID, and quantity of the item they wish to purchase. The app will let them know if their transaction is possible based on the avalibility of the item.
